<a href="rocket.pdf">Rocket-fast proof checking for SMT solvers</a>,
submitted to TACAS 2008. <a href="fx8-r1091.tar.gz">fx8-r1091.tar.gz</a>
contains  a snapshot of the fx8 branch of fx7. This includes the C, OCaml
and Maude implementation of the proof checker (in <tt>trew/</tt> subdirectory).
There are also rewrite rules (in <tt>prelude.rw</tt>) as well as
the Coq translation of them (in <tt>trew/prelude.v</tt>).

<h2>Implementation (Fx7 prover)</h2>

<p>
Available at the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/michal.moskal/fx7/">BitBucket mercurial repository</a>, 
under BSD-like license. There is also an Fx8 branch there,
where the solver is capable of producing proofs.
The current version already passes
most of the smt-lib AUFLIA division problems as well as all the Boogie
benchmarks. The solver was second in the AUFLIA division of 2007 SMT-COMP.
</p>
<p>It is based on C# port of the minisat SAT solver, with which it cooperates
in a half-backed DPLL(T) (no theory propagation). It is written in 
<a href="http://nemerle.org/">Nemerle</a> (except for minisat).
</p>

<p><a href="ChangeLog">A ChangeLog</a> is available. It is updated hourly (it's only for the main branch).</p>

<p>The human being behind all that stuff is <a
href="http://nemerle.org/~malekith/">Michal Moskal</a>.  I'm open for
cooperation, with potential co-developers as well as potential users
(which are probably going to be software verification systems).
